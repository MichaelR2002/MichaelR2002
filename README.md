<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Michael!</h1>

## ðŸš€ About Me
   Proud graduate from Southeastern Louisiana University with a degree in Computer Science - Information Technology, where I spent most of my time learning languages and methods for DevOps, all the while working on the projects listed below. 

   I got my start at Source 1 Solutions as an intern, learned the ropes fast, and now work there as a Junior System Administrator. These days I focus on solving weird tech problems, and always looking for ways to make things faster, cleaner, and less of a headache.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current & Future Focus
- Acquiring certifications relevant to my future endeavors
- Expanding skills in system administration and engineering
- Returning to DevOps and coding projects I enjoyed during college
- Building solutions that are fast, reliable, and user-friendly
