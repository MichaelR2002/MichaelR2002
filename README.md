## 🚀 About Me
    Proud graduate from Southeastern Louisiana University with a degree in Computer Science - Information Technology, where I spent most of my time learning languages and methods for DevOps, all the while working on the projects listed below. 

    I got my start at Source 1 Solutions as an intern, learned the ropes fast, and now work there as a Junior System Administrator. These days I focus on solving weird tech problems, and always looking for ways to make things faster, cleaner, and less of a headache.

## 🎯 Current Focus
- 📚 Acquiring certifications that align with my future goals.
- 🧩 Developing automation
- 🧪 Exploring **new languages and paradigms** — I have my favorites, but my desire for knowledge never ends.

## 📂 Featured Projects

| **AppLocker Deployment Script** | Automated AppLocker policy rollout with error handling and XML management | Repeatable, auditable enforcement with fast rollback |

| **Cloud Cost Monitor** | Resource usage tracker with alerting | Visibility and cost controls without busywork |

## 🤝 How I Work
- **Design for Day-2:** Operability, logging, and maintenance plans are part of the MVP.
- **Change with Confidence:** Small, reversible changes; documented, peer-reviewed.
- **SLOs over Vibes:** Define success criteria and instrument to it.
